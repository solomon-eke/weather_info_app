# Weather Info App

A simple Flutter app that fetches and displays the user's weather information based on their location.

## Features

- **Location Permission**: The app checks and requests location permission from the user.
- **Fetch User Location**: After permission is granted, the app fetches the user's current location (latitude and longitude).
- **Weather Data Placeholder**: Placeholder for weather data display (you can later integrate a weather API to show the weather).

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK
- Geolocator package for location services
